CHAT BACKUP (generated by Codex)
Date: 2026-02-09

NOTE: I don't have a full transcript of the entire chat history from the UI. This file includes a concise summary of key decisions and the current system state based on my working context.

SUMMARY
- Project split: app_control (Flutter) and esp32 (Arduino ESP32-S3).
- Board: YD-ESP32-23 (ESP32-S3-WROOM-1). RGB LED on GPIO48.
- Relay enable: GPIO16 (Active-HIGH). Now held LOW during boot; starts OFF until command.
- BTS7960 pins: RPWM=GPIO4, LPWM=GPIO5, REN=GPIO17, LEN=GPIO18.
- L298N steering: ENA=GPIO21 (jumpered HIGH), IN1=GPIO38, IN2=GPIO39. Steering uses directional ON/OFF (no PWM). Time limit enabled: 5 seconds.
- Rear motor: soft-start ramp, min PWM 10%.
- App: keeps screen awake using wakelock_plus; speed slider min=10; UDP sends control + ping payload.

RECENT COMMITS
- 797497f update motor pins and soft-start
- 3795ae7 steer motor time limit and relay default off
- 5739e22 relay default off and L298 enable jumper
- 2159809 remove steering time limit (later reverted)
- d1146f7 restore steering time limit
- 5ce914d keep screen awake while app is open
